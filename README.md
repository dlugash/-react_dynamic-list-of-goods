# React dynamic list of goods

[DEMO](https://dlugash.github.io/-react_dynamic-list-of-goods/)

## Task

* Render 3 buttons loading the goods from server and saving them in the state:
* Load All goods shows all the received goods
* Load 5 first goods shows 5 first goods after sorting them by name
* Load red goods containing only red goods
* Server has only 1 endpoint returning all the goods, so you should prepare them after receiving.
* Create a component GoodsList accepting an array of goods and rendering them inside an ul tag
* Print a name of each good using good.color(for example style={{ color: 'red' }})
* There should be a new request to the server on each button click.
